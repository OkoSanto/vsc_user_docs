\chapter{Orchestration using Heat templates}

\gls{Heat} is the name of the OpenStack orchestration engine, which can manage complete configurations of all servers, volumes, users, \ldots\  that make up a cloud application.  Instead of managing every component separately, we can create, start, stop or clean up our complete application in a single step.  Such a set of collectively managed resources is called a \gls{Stack}.
