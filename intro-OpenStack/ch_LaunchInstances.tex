\chapter{Launch and manage instances}\label{cha:launch-manage-inst}
Instances are virtual machines that run inside the cloud. You can launch
an \gls{instance} from the following sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item Images uploaded to the Image service.  Note that, because images
    are read-only, any changes made while the instance is running will
    be lost after shutdown, unless you choose to ``Create New
    Volume''.  If you create a new volume, the VM's state will persist
    after shutdown.
  \item Image that you have copied to a persistent volume. The instance
  launches from the volume, which is provided by the
  \textbf{cinder-volume} API through iSCSI.
\item Instance snapshot that you took.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Launch an instance}\label{launch-an-instance}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the Compute tab and click Instances category.

  The dashboard shows the instances with its name, its private and
  floating IP addresses, size, status, task, power state, and so on.
\item Click Launch Instance.
\item In the Launch Instance dialog box, specify the following values:

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/tab-compute-instances-launch.png}
  \end{center}
  
  \begin{description}
  \item[Details] tab
    \begin{description}
    \item[Instance Name] Assign a name to the virtual machine.

      \strong{Note:} The name you assign here becomes the initial host
      name of the server. If the name is longer than 63 characters,
      the Compute service truncates it automatically to ensure dnsmasq
      works correctly.

      After the server is built, if you change the server name in the
      API or change the host name directly, the names are not updated
      in the dashboard.

      Server names are not guaranteed to be unique when created so you
      could have two instances with the same host name.

    \item[Description] You can assign a brief description of the
      virtual machine.
    \item[Availability Zone] By default, this value is set to the
      availability zone given by the cloud provider (for example,
      \strong{us-west} or \strong{apac-south}).  For some cases, it
      could be \strong{nova}.
    \item[Count] To launch multiple instances, enter a value greater
      than \strong{1}. The default is \strong{1}.
    \end{description}

    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/launch_instance_source}
    \end{center}
  \item[Source] tab
  \begin{description}
  \item[Select Boot Source] Your options are:
    \begin{description}
    \item[Image]
    \item[Image snapshot]
    \item[Volume]
    \item[Volume snapshot]
    \end{description}
    Depending on the type of boot source, the list of available items
    changes.

  \item[Create New Volume] If you enable this option when launching
    from an image or instance snapshot, the image or snapshot will be
    copied to a volume.  This way, the state of your instance persists
    after shutdown and reboot.
  \end{description}

\item[Flavor] tab. Specify the size of the instance to launch.

  \strong{Note:} The flavor is selected based on the size of the image
  selected for launching an instance. For example, while creating an
  image, if you have entered the value in the Minimum RAM (MB) field
  as 2048, then on selecting the image, the default flavor is
  \textbf{m1.small}.  If a '!' warning sign is displayed next to a
  resource for one of the flavors, that means that this flavor would
  exceed the project's quota for that resource, and therefore is not
  available.

\item[Networks] tab. Add one or more networks to the instance.

\item[Network Ports] tab. Activate the ports that you want to assign to
  the instance.
\item[Security Groups] tab. Activate the security groups that you want
  to assign to the instance.

  Security groups are a kind of cloud firewall that define which
  incoming network traffic is forwarded to instances.

  The default security group is assigned to the instance
  automatically.
\item[Key Pair] tab. Specify a key pair.

  If the image uses a static root password or a static key set
  (neither is recommended), you do not need to provide a key pair to
  launch the instance.
\item[Configuration] tab. Specify a customization script that runs
  after your instance launches.

\item[Server Groups] tab.

\item[Scheduler Hints] tab.

\item[Metadata] tab. Add Metadata items to your instance.
\end{description}

\item Click Launch Instance.
\end{enumerate}

The instance starts on a compute node in the cloud.

\strong{Note:} If you did not provide a key pair, security groups, or
rules, users can access the instance only from inside the cloud
through VNC. Even pinging the instance is not possible without an ICMP
rule configured.

You can also launch an instance from the Images or Volumes category when
you launch an instance from an image or a volume respectively.

When you launch an instance from an image, OpenStack creates a local
copy of the image on the compute node where the instance starts.

For details on creating images, see
\href{https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/create-images-manually.html}{\emph{Creating
images manually}} in the \emph{OpenStack Virtual Machine Image Guide}.

\subsection*{Connect to your instance using SSH}\label{connect-to-your-instance-using-ssh}

In order to be able to reach an instance from outside of OpenStack,
you must associate a floating IP to it, as detailed in section
\ref{allocate-a-floating-ip-address-to-an-instance} on page
\pageref{allocate-a-floating-ip-address-to-an-instance}.
Additionally, you must have access to the private key of the keypair
for that instance.

You can only reach the floating IP's from the UGent login node
\lstinline{login.hpc.ugent.be}, so you'll need to access the UGent
login node first, and hop to your instance from there.  As you
shouldn't keep the private keys in your VSC storage space, you need to
set up an SSH agent with key forwarding on the local machine where you store the private keys.  Section 2.1.4 of the HPC tutorial explains how to set this up (\url{https://www.vscentrum.be/support/tut-book/vsc-tutorials}).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect to the UGent login node, using the \lstinline{ssh -A} option
  to enable agent forwarding:

  \begin{prompt}
    %\shellcmd{ssh -A vsc12345@login.hpc.ugent.be}
  \end{prompt}

\item Copy the address of the floating IP associated with your
  instance.  In our example, the address is 193.190.85.40.

\item From the login node, connect to the instance. For example:

  \begin{prompt}
    %\shellcmd{ssh ubuntu@193.190.85.40}
  \end{prompt}

  The default images do not allow ssh logins for the root user.  There
  is a default user instead, who can get administrator privileges
  using \lstinline{sudo}.  In our example, we have used the username
  \lstinline{ubuntu} for Ubuntu images.  Attempting to log in as root
  will return an error message with the proper user name.
  % TODO: proper section on usernames, sudo, ...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Track usage for instances}\label{track-usage-for-instances}

You can track usage for instances for each project. You can track costs
per month by showing meters like number of vCPUs, disks, RAM, and uptime
for all your instances.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the Compute tab and click Overview category.
\item To query the instance usage for a month, select a month and click
  Submit.
\item To download a summary, click Download CSV Summary.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Create an instance snapshot}\label{create-an-instance-snapshot}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the Compute tab and click the Instances
  category.
\item Select the instance from which to create a snapshot.
\item In the actions column, click Create Snapshot.
\item In the Create Snapshot dialog box, enter a name for the snapshot, and
  click Create Snapshot.
\end{enumerate}

The Images category shows the instance snapshot.

To launch an instance from the snapshot, select the snapshot and click
Launch. Proceed with launching an instance.

\subsection*{Manage an instance}\label{manage-an-instance}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the Compute tab and click Instances category.
\item Select an instance.
\item In the menu list in the actions column, select the state.
\end{enumerate}

You can resize or rebuild an instance. You can also choose to view the
instance console log, edit instance or the security groups. Depending on
the current state of the instance, you can pause, resume, suspend, soft
or hard reboot, or terminate it.

\strong{Difference between \emph{suspend}, \emph{pause}, \emph{shelve}, \emph{shut off}, \emph{delete}}\label{server-power-down-states}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suspend: Stores the state of the VM on the disk, all memory is written to disk, and the server is stopped.
\item Pause: Stores the state of the VM in the (RAM) memory.
\item Shelve: Shelving stops the instance and takes a snapshot of it. Then depending on the value of the \emph{shelved\_offload\_time} config option, the instance is either deleted from the hypervisor (0), never deleted (-1), or deleted after some period of time (> 0). Shelve preserves all associated data and VM resources but does not retain anything in memory.
\item Shut off: The server is powered down by the user, either through the OpenStack Compute API, or from within the server by issuing a \emph{shutdown -h} command. In this state the user retains all computational resources associated with the VM. The instance can be later restarted.
\item Delete: The VM is deleted and removed from \gls{OpenStack} together with any associated processes and resources.
\end{enumerate}
